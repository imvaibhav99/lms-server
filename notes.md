npm i -D nodemon ->it is installed only in development but not in production(build)

NODE_ENV=development ->the environment in which i am working

import the express and start the server

# Handling the security of the reqests made by the user
//restricts the maximum size of the incoming request body to 10 kilobytes
<!-- app.use(express.json({limit: '10kb'})) .
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true, limit: '10kb'})) -->
//parses form submissions, supports nested objects (if extended: true), max size 10kb.


# Request logger middleware to avoid console.log() everytime
->npm i morgan (installation)
chech if development-> app.use(morgan("dev"))
O/P in console <!-- GET / 404 3.235 ms - 46 -->
gives the logs everytime calling the apis

# Global Error Handlers
<!-- app.use((err,req,res,next)=>{
    console.error(err.stack); //Prints the full stack trace of the error in the console
    res.status(err.status||500).json({

        ...(process.env.NODE_ENV==='development' && {stack: err.stack})

    });
}); -->


// Security middlewares:

# Rate limiter to limit the np. of requests per user 
->Always on the top after PORT 
->npm i express-rate-limiter
then set the time:15minutes and no. of max requests as 100.

# Helmet for extra security
->npm i helmet
then just app.use(helmet()) as a middleware

# express-mongoose-sanitizer -> DB sanitization
->npm install express-mongo-sanitize
and use it as middleware

# hpp, middleware ->for preventing the pollution
->npm i hpp : use it as a middleware

# now install cookie-parser to parse the cookie from the browser and add it at Body parser middleware

 # cors: always add above the API routes:

 USE STRICT CONFIGURATION FOR THE CORS
 
 <!-- app.use(cors({

# Handled the Database connection in industry standard way with all the proper constructors and necessary functions,along with the no. of retries etc.

<!-- mkdir models  -->
<!-- touch course.model.js courseProgress.js course
Purchase.model.js lecture.model.js user.model.js -->

->Install bcryptjs; npm i mongoose bcryptjs crypto(to generate secure random tokens)

# created user.model.js:
->created all the necessary fields
-> match: [/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/, "Please provide a valid email"] write the validation message along with the regex

->    resetPasswordToken:String,
    resetPasswordExpire:Date,  temporary token for password reset and expiry date

->Then password hashing before signup is done of new user and saved to DB
->compare entered password with last hashed password

->then reset password token,hashed with SHA-256,expirey time 10min,return the raw token(via email)

<!-- Virtuals are document properties that you can get and set, but they donâ€™t exist in MongoDB.
They are computed values based on other fields in your schema.
They are not persisted in the database but exist only in Mongoose objects.
Think of them like "calculated fields" or "derived attributes". -->

# .pre and .post are the two hooks provided by the mongoose,for actions before(pre) and after(post) the main operation (save in DB)
